# Welcome to my cool second school project!!

This is TEnmo, a project created in cahoots with Jon Fleet and myself, Dylan Underwood. We're both students at Tech Elevator Pittsburgh.

# What is this
TEnmo mimics a low-level version of Venmo where we manipulate server and database communication to make accounts as well as send and request money transfers

# How do I make it work?

1) Make sure you run the tenmo.sql file in SQLServer or whatever database script stuff you have! You have to build the database!
2) Open the Tenmo Client and Server solutions (TenmoClient.sln + TenmoServer.sln) hopefully in VS Code!
3) Make sure and run the Server in VS code THEN the Client and a command line app should show up!
4) Make sure you register a user, then login
5) Have fun messing with fake transfers and such!
